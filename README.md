# Kirsten Phillips
I'm a full-stack software engineer working to grow my skill set, with an eagerness to build high-quality software products to support critical missions.

This is my personal website, which I intend to use to display my résumé as well as supplemental information about myself, my experiences, and side projects that I'm working on.

This site was built with Next.js, React, NextUI, and Tailwind CSS and it is deployed using GitHub pages to https://k-h-phillips.github.io. 

This is my first ever deployed website that I created in my spare time off work, and I'm very proud of it! That being said, I'll continue to make tweaks to it as I receive feedback and as my style preferences evolve.
